      I'm not writing this to argue over the past, but i can understand how i overwhelmed you with my demands at times, which may have pushed you away and that only makes room for correction. Correction for both of us. And we both can‚Äôt pretend that we‚Äôre totally indifferent about each other all of a sudden cause if it's one thing i know, you didn't stop loving me, you just got tired of fighting over the same things. I did too.

      But we can either part ways and keep carrying the weight of how we could‚Äôve done things differently or we can learn from them and grow to never repeat the mistakes( Proverbs 26:11 ) and never mention them again. It was never meant to be easy, but easy isn‚Äôt worth fighting for.

      Ky, If we do in fact only live once, I want to share every laugh, every struggle, every dream with you in this one. Let‚Äôs make new memories, as strangers that already know each other. Saves you the trouble of telling someone else that you prefer tulips to roses or that you love pink and oversize jerseys. Let's give a second chapter to our story and give it the happily ever after ending we deserve. . Best regards shorty. I hope this appeals to the good side of you :)

      Yours Failthfully, Devonte Andy.
