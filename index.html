I pushed you to do what you did by being demanding and controlling which doesn't justify your actions but makes room for correction. Correction for both of us. We're okay without each other but we can be even better with each other. we can either part ways and keep punishing the present with the past or we can learn from them and move forward only if we can both decide to not return to our old mistakes. Proverbs 26:11: we would be foolish to our old bad ways. If we do in fact only live once, I want to share every laugh, every struggle, every dream with you in this one. Ky, Let‚Äôs make new memories, as strangers that already know each other. Let's move on together and never mention the past few months. Let's give a second chapter to our story and give it the happily ever after ending.  Best regards shorty. I hope to hear from you again :) yours Failthfully, Devonte Andy.",
